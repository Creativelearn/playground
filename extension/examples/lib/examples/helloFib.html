<h1>Hello world with Fibonacci!</h1>

<p>
    The first example should explain the most basic techniques used in jsreport. 
</p>

<p>
    Assembling reports in jsreport is based on javascript templating engines. 
    You define a html template with special tags like this one and jsreport will
    use templating engines rendering and creates report output for you. Output can be html, 
    pdf and others will come. This example is rendering simple html, but you will learn 
    about other output formats in the next examples.
</p>

<p>
    In the integrated template designer is the template on the left side. You
    can find a preview of the final report on the right side. Using "Run" button
    from the toolbar will invoke post to the jsreport server and displays the
    output in the preview pane. Go ahead and try it!
</p>

<p>
    Every template can contains javascript helpers. This 
    comes from basic concepts of javascript templating engines. The content tab
    contains the report design and the helpers can contain any javascript function
    that can do some computations required in the report. Go ahead and 
    switch "Content" and "Helpers" tabs to see whats there.
</p>

<p>
    Enought of theory. Following is the very simple example generating 10 items 
    from fibonacci sequence and rendering them into html table. It's using helper
    function called fibSequence to get the seqence and basic jsrender tags to render
    a table.
</p>

<table border="1">  
    <th>n-position</th>
    <th>fib value</th>
   
    <!-- we can call helper functions in jsrender using ~ -->
    {{for ~fibSequence(10)}}
    <tr style="background-color:#DD66{{:#data.i}}0">
        <!-- #data is floating context that is always referencing current item source.  --> 
        <td>{{:#data.i}}</td>
        <td>{{:#data.val}}</td>
    </tr>    
    {{/for}}
