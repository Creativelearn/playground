<h1>Extensions - inlining input data </h1>

<p>
    jsReport uses concept of extensions to allow the comunity to make
    jsReport more and more powerfull. Extensions can participate on 
    defining report template or gathering report input data. You can
    see the active extensions in the left menu. There is currently Data 
    and Scripts extension as you can see.

<p>
    This example shows quickly the power of Data extension. Data extension
    allows to insert static data into report input. This can be very
    handy when defining and testing report template where inline data
    will be replaced by dynamic data in the production. This way of work
    is probably the most common with jsReport. The report template contains
    report layout and the input data differs everytime report is rendered.

    Checkout the input data in the left menu. It's just a collection of
    bbc articles. This collection is itterated and printed in the 
    following code.
